**Tableau Dashboard – Global Supply Chain Shipment Analysis**

**Project Title**:
Analyzing Global Health Supply Chain Shipments Using Tableau
Course Project – UMass Amherst (MS in Business Analytics)

**Overview**:
This project visualizes and analyzes global supply chain shipment data related to pharmaceutical and diagnostic products across over 20 countries. Using Tableau, I developed interactive dashboards to uncover insights on product types, delivery timelines, vendors, transport modes, dosage forms, and delays.
The primary goal was to create a centralized visual interface for logistics decision-making, supplier evaluation, and identifying bottlenecks in the health product supply chain.

**Objectives**:
• Identify high-volume shipment products and transport modes
• Analyze late delivery trends by vendor, shipment method, and brand
• Track shipment volumes across countries and years
• Evaluate cost-efficiency via unit pricing and dosage form insights
• Explore product distribution by weight, vendor contribution, and packaging types

**Dashboard Highlights**:
• Global Map of shipments by country and product group
• Product Volume Trends from 2006–2015 across ARV, HRDT, MRDT, ACT, ANTM
• Shipment Mode Analysis (Air Cargo, Sea Freight, Truck)
• Late Delivery Breakdown by year, product group, vendor, and brand
• Dosage Form & Weight Distribution (Tablet, Capsule, Oral Solution, Test Kit)
• Pricing Comparison: Unit Price vs Pack Price by relationship type

**Files Included**:
Tableau_Anand_Gupta.twbx: Packaged Tableau dashboard file,
Anand_Gupta_Supply_Chain_Shipment.xlsx: Cleaned and structured data,
Tableau_Anand_Gupta.pdf: Exported version of the dashboard for offline review

**Tools & Stack**:
• Tableau: Dashboard development and visualization
• Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and transformation
• Mapbox / OpenStreetMap: Geospatial visualizations
• Supply Chain KPIs: On-time delivery, vendor performance, volume analysis

**Key Insights**:
• Air Cargo dominated high-priority shipments but had higher rates of late deliveries
• Generic brands accounted for over 75% of products delivered late
• ARV and HRDT were the most shipped product groups, with notable variance in delivery success
• A few vendors (e.g., SCMS From RDC) contributed to over 50% of total late deliveries
• Tablets and capsules represented the highest volume dosage forms
• Cost breakdowns revealed inconsistencies between pack pricing and unit cost measures
